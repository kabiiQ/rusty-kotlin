# rusty-kotlin [![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/kabiiQ/rusty-kotlin.svg)](https://jitpack.io/#moe.kabii/rusty-kotlin)

Small library of simple functional-esque structures: Option, Result, Try, Either. 

I made this mostly for my own benefit of messing around with generics but have been using some, particularly Result, in my own projects. [Result](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/result/) and Option are directly inspired by those from the [Rust language](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

I drew from my own understanding of what I wanted these structures to do, thus if you are looking to work on a proper functionally designed project in Kotlin you probably want to look at [Arrow](https://github.com/arrow-kt/arrow/).
